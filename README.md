# üóÇÔ∏è Collaborative Task Board

A real-time collaborative task board built with Angular, MSAL authentication, and Socket.IO.
Users can add, assign, edit, delete, and move items using drag-and-drop. Changes are synced instantly across clients and persisted in MongoDB. Only assigned users can modify their items.

### üß© Client

- Angular
- MSAL for authentication
- [ngx-drag-drop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swimlane/ngx-drag-drop) for drag-and-drop functionality
- [ngx-toastr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-toastr) for notifications
- [socket.io-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-client)
- Sass (SCSS)
- Bootstrap 5

### ‚öôÔ∏è Server

- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.IO
- MongoDB

### üê≥ Docker

- Run the full stack (client, server, database) using Docker Compose
- Build and start containers with one command
- Ensures consistency across environments

## Features

- **Authentication**

  - Login using **MSAL (Microsoft Azure AD)** with redirect flow.
  - Persist login across page refreshes.

- **Real-time Collaboration**

  - Users see updates instantly via **Socket.IO**.
  - Multiple clients synchronize in real-time.

- **Item Management**

  - Add, edit, delete, and update items.
  - Drag-and-drop interaction for task organization.
  - Move items between statuses (ToDo, In Progress, Done).
  - Only assigned users can make changes to their items.

- **Persistence**

  - **MongoDB** stores users and items for persistence.
  - Maintains item state and user assignments across sessions.

- **Client-side State Management**
  - Angular signals manage active user and item states.

## Requirements

Before running the app locally, make sure you have the following installed and configured:

- **Node.js** (v20.x recommended)
- **Angular CLI** (v19.x)
- **MongoDB**
  - Either local MongoDB or Docker container
  - Ensure the connection string is added to `.env` as `DB`
- **Azure / MSAL Authentication**
  - Register an app in [Microsoft Entra ID](https://entra.microsoft.com/)
  - Obtain **Tenant ID**, **Client ID**, and **Redirect URI**
  - Add these values to `.env` as `authority`, `clientId`, and `REDIRECT_URI`
- **Docker** (optional if using Docker Compose)

## Installation

‚ú® If server runs on port 3000, make sure the client points to that ‚ú®

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/welcey96/websockets-shoppingList
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd websockets
```

Install dependencies on client and server

```bash
  cd server
  npm install
```

```bash
  cd client
  npm install
```

Start server

```bash
  ...websockets > cd server
  ...websockets\server > npm run dev
```

Start client

```bash
  ...websockets > cd client
  ...websockets\client > npm run start
```

## üê≥ Running with Docker

You can also run the entire stack using Docker Compose. The provided ```compose.dev.yaml``` will build and run images for the ```client```, ```server```, and ```MongoDB```.

Run the following command in the project root:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --build
```
##### This will:

- Build Docker images for client and server

- Start containers for client, server, and MongoDB

- Expose ports so you can access the app in your browser

To stop and remove containers:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml down
```
